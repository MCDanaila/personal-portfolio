        "description": "I was born in Romania and moved to Italy at the age of three. After completing my studies in Computer Science at La Sapienza University in Rome, I began my professional career there. After a short period, I took the opportunity to move to Milan, driven by a long-term goal: reaching Switzerland, a land of opportunity, the place I had always imagined, where the mountains welcome you.\n\nAfter a few years spent developing my skills in the fintech sector in Milan, I eventually moved to Switzerland. There, I discovered a wide range of new opportunities. I started studying German while continuing to work, until I decided to further invest in my education by pursuing a master’s degree.\n\nI first entered academia and then enrolled in the Master’s program in Applied Computational Life Sciences at the ZHAW School of Life Sciences, which I completed part-time while working at the University of Zurich. After finishing my degree, I continued my academic path at ETH Zurich.\n\nWith artificial intelligence evolving rapidly, I am strongly motivated to be part of this technological transformation and to contribute to it in a meaningful way.\n\nOutside of work and coding, I spend time at the gym. I am also a certified personal trainer and enjoy outdoor activities.",
